# Password Generator

**Password Generator** is a Python tool designed to help you create strong, secure passwords. You can customize the length of the password, and choose whether to include numbers and special characters. It generates up to 3 password suggestions at once, making it easy to create unique, secure passwords that are difficult to crack.

## How It Works

The Password Generator begins by asking you for preferences such as the password length, and whether you want to include numbers or special characters. By default, it ensures that the generated passwords meet the minimum security requirements by using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

Once you provide your preferences, the tool generates 3 random password suggestions for you. If you're not satisfied with the results, you can opt to generate more passwords. This process ensures you can pick the strongest option that fits your needs. The user-friendly prompts guide you through each step, making it easy to use, even if you don't have much experience with password management.
